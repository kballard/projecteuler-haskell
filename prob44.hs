-- Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P_n=n(3n1)/2. The first ten
-- pentagonal numbers are:
--
--                1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...
--
-- It can be seen that P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8. However, their
-- difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.
--
-- Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P_j and P_k, for which their sum and
-- difference is pentagonal and D = |P_k - P_j| is minimised; what is the value
-- of D?
